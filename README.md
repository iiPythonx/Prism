# Prism

### The only discord bot you need.

---

Prism is a multipurpose discord bot focused on entertainment & currency.

It is built in Python using `discord.py` and multiple other libraries.

For a better storyline and some history, check `assets/prism.py`.

#### Setup

Getting started with Prism is pretty easy thanks to Prism 1.4.

  
However, before you continue make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or above

- Git



If you have all of those installed, run these commands in a terminal:

*Please note: if you use Linux you might have to use `python3` rather than `python.`*


```

git clone https://github.com/ii-Python/Prism

cd Prism

python setup.py

```

---



When all of that is complete, you can start Prism by running `python main.py`.
