# Prism
### The only discord bot you need.
---

Prism is a multipurpose discord bot focused on entertainment & currency.
It is built in Python using `discord.py`.

---

#### Setup

Getting started with Prism is pretty easy thanks to Prism 1.4.
However, before you continue make sure you have the following installed:
    - Python 3.6 or above
    - Git

If you have all of those installed, run these commands in a terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/ii-Python/Prism/Prism.git

cd Prism

python setup.py
```

*Please note: if you use linux you might have to use `python3` rather than `python.`*
---

When all of that is complete, you can start Prism by running `python main.py`.
